Artificial Neural Networks
==========================

Here is a list of some standard neural networks written in python. They were
made to be simple and useful for students. Each script is self-contained and is
around a hundred of lines. Numpy is required for simulation and matplotlib for
visualization.

* Perceptron
* Multi layer perceptron
* Elman recurrent network
* Jordan recurrent network
* Hopfield (not yet done)
* ART 1
* Self organizing map
* Neural gas
* Growing neural gas (not yet done)
* Voronoi (if you want to display the voronoi diagram).
