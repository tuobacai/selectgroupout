This is a basic implementation of Logistic Regression.

This includes a basic implementation of batch-gradient descent program. It can be tweaked with custom learning rate.

Logistic Regression in python.

This program has been updated to work for both Multi-Class classification and 2 class classification tasks.

Things to do:
==================
1) Include support for Stochastic Gradient Descent.
